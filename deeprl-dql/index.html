The agent then takes an action \(a_0\) according to a policy \(\pi\) (which just tells the agent to take an action from a given state), and receives a reward \(r_0\) and the next state \(s_1\). One way of finding a good policy is using deep Q learning. Each episode consists of all state, actions, and rewards from beginning to end.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><h2 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h2><p>Reinforcement learning using neural networks is unstable and difficult to train.

One measure of the importance of experiences is the TD error, which is the absolute value of the difference between target and local rewards.

Because we're sampling from a nonuniform distribution, we have to multiply the TD errors with something called the importance sampling weights, \(w_i=\left(\frac{1}{N \cdot  P(i)}\right)^\beta\). We also can update the priorities for the experiences in the replay buffer.
